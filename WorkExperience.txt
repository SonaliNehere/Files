🧩 Your CI/CD Process — Simple Explanation:
You write code and commit to Git
👉 This means you're saving your latest changes in the shared project.

When your team wants to give a release,
👉 You go to Jenkins, and start a build + release job.

Jenkins starts working:

It pulls the latest code from Git.

It builds the project (compiles code, runs tests, etc.).

If build is successful, it creates a ZIP file (the final release package).

That ZIP file is automatically uploaded to Artifactory
👉 So other teams or servers can use it to deploy the app.

🤖 So What is CI/CD in This?
CI (Continuous Integration) = Code is integrated (committed) to Git.

CD (Continuous Delivery) = Jenkins builds and delivers (uploads) the release ZIP to Artifactory.

📢 How You Can Say It in Interview:
"In my project, we follow CI/CD. I commit code to Git. When a release is needed, we trigger a Jenkins job that builds the code
	and automatically uploads the release ZIP to Artifactory. This makes the release process smooth and automated."

✅ Correct!
In your case, Continuous Deployment is not done.

Here's why:
You said:
“I commit. Then when we want to give a release, we do build and release on Jenkins. After that, the ZIP is uploaded to
	Artifactory.”

That means:
The release is manually triggered.
Jenkins uploads the ZIP to Artifactory.
But the code is not automatically deployed to a server (like production or staging).

So this is:
CI/CD Term	Meaning	Is it in your process?
CI (Continuous Integration)	- Automatically building and testing code after commit	✅ Yes
CD (Continuous Delivery)	- Automatically preparing the build and storing it (e.g., in Artifactory)	✅ Yes
CD (Continuous Deployment)	- Automatically deploying the build to live servers	❌ No (you do this manually or not at all)

📌 In simple words:
"In our project, we follow CI and Continuous Delivery, but not Continuous Deployment. Code is built and released through 
	Jenkins, and the release ZIP goes to Artifactory. But actual deployment to production is done manually."

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Java**

### **Q1: What are the key features of Java?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for:  
- **Platform Independence** (Write Once, Run Anywhere using JVM)  
- **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**  
- **Multithreading & Concurrency**  
- **Robust Exception Handling**  
- **Strong Security Features**  

### **Q2: Explain OOPs concepts in Java.**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java follows four main OOP principles:  
- **Encapsulation:** Hiding implementation details using private variables and public methods.  
- **Inheritance:** Reusing code by extending a class.  
- **Polymorphism:** Multiple forms of a method (Overloading & Overriding).  
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation using abstract classes and interfaces.  

### **Q3: What are Java Collections? Name some commonly used classes.**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java Collections Framework provides reusable data structures. Common classes include:  
- **List (ArrayList, LinkedList)** ‚Äì Ordered, allows duplicates.  
- **Set (HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet)** ‚Äì Unique elements only.  
- **Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)** ‚Äì Key-value pairs.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced System Design**

### **Q4: What is System Design?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** System design is the process of defining the **architecture, components, modules, and data flow** of a system to meet performance, scalability, and reliability requirements.  

### **Q5: What is the CAP Theorem?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** The **CAP theorem** states that in a distributed system, you can only achieve two of the following three properties:  
- **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write.  
- **Availability (A):** Every request gets a response, even if it's not the latest.  
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to function even if network partitions occur.  
Most real-world distributed systems (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra) choose **AP or CP**.  

### **Q6: What are Load Balancers?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** A **Load Balancer** distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure reliability. Types include:  
- **DNS Load Balancing** (Round-robin across multiple IPs)  
- **Application Load Balancers (Layer 7 - HTTP/HTTPS requests)**  
- **Network Load Balancers (Layer 4 - TCP/UDP packets)**

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Microservices**

### **Q7: What is an API Gateway?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** An **API Gateway** is a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices system. It helps with:  
- **Routing requests to the appropriate microservice.**  
- **Security** (JWT authentication, rate limiting).  
- **Logging & Monitoring** (centralized request tracking).  
Example: **Netflix Zuul, Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong API Gateway**.  

### **Q8: What is the Circuit Breaker Pattern?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** The **Circuit Breaker** pattern prevents cascading failures in microservices by stopping calls to an unresponsive service. It has three states:  
- **Closed:** All requests are allowed.  
- **Open:** Requests are blocked after failures exceed a threshold.  
- **Half-Open:** A few test requests are sent to check recovery.  
Example: **Resilience4J, Hystrix**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps & Cloud**

### **Q9: What is CI/CD, and how does it work?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)** automates the software release process.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Developers merge code frequently, and automated tests are run (e.g., using Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Successful builds are automatically deployed to production.  

### **Q10: How does Kubernetes help in microservices deployment?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** **Kubernetes (K8s)** is an orchestration tool for deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. It provides:  
- **Load balancing and service discovery.**  
- **Auto-scaling based on traffic.**  
- **Self-healing (automatic restarts on failure).**

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Tools & Platforms (Docker, AWS, Postman, Kibana, Git)**

### **Q11: How did you use Docker in your projects?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Docker was used for:  
- **Containerizing Spring Boot microservices** for portability.  
- **Running MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch containers** for testing.  

### **Q12: What AWS services have you worked with?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** I have **basic experience with AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS)**:  
- **EC2** for hosting backend services.  
- **S3** for storing static assets.  
- **Lambda** for serverless function execution.  
- **RDS** for managed database services.

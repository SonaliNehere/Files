🔍 What is a Meta-Annotation in Spring Boot (and Java in general)?
A meta-annotation is an annotation that is used to annotate other annotations.
In Spring Boot and Spring Framework, meta-annotations are widely used to build custom annotations with built-in Spring behavior
	like @Component, @Transactional, @RequestMapping, etc.

🧠 Java Meta-Annotations (Standard)
Java provides built-in meta-annotations like:

Meta-Annotation		Purpose
@Target				- Specifies where the annotation can be applied (method, class, field, etc.)
@Retention			- Defines how long the annotation is retained (source, class, runtime)
@Inherited			- Allows subclasses to inherit annotations
@Documented			- Includes annotation in Javadoc

✅ Spring's Use of Meta-Annotations
Spring allows developers to create custom annotations that behave like Spring-managed beans or configurations by combining
 annotations.

🧾 Example 1: Spring’s own @RestController
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@Controller
@ResponseBody
public @interface RestController {
}
Here, @RestController is itself annotated with @Controller and @ResponseBody.
So, it acts as a meta-annotation wrapper to reduce boilerplate.

🧾 Example 2: Creating Your Own Meta-Annotation
@Target(ElementType.TYPE)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@Documented
@Component
public @interface MyService {
}
Now, you can use @MyService on a class:

@MyService
public class MyBusinessLogic {
}
Spring will treat it like a @Component-scanned bean because of the meta-annotation.

🔁 Why Use Meta-Annotations in Spring Boot?
✅ Reduce repetitive annotations
✅ Create domain-specific annotations (like @SecuredAdmin, @JsonApi, etc.)
✅ Promote cleaner and more maintainable code
✅ Encapsulate complex configurations or behaviors

🧠 Bonus: Composed Annotations
Spring calls these composed annotations—annotations that combine other annotations using meta-annotations.

✅ Summary
Term				Description
Meta-Annotation		- Annotation that is applied on another annotation
Use in Spring		- To create custom annotations with built-in behavior
Example				- @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
Custom Usage		- @MyService = @Component

==============================================================================

To implement basic authentication in Spring Boot using a properties file — and ensure it happens before the request reaches 
	the controller — you can achieve this in a clean way using Spring Security with in-memory user details configured in 
	application.properties or application.yml.

✅ Goal:
Authenticate users before hitting the controller
Users and passwords defined in application.properties
Use Spring Security filter chain to intercept requests

✅ Step-by-Step Implementation
1️⃣ Add Spring Security Dependency
If you're using Maven:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
2️⃣ Configure Users in application.properties
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=admin123
spring.security.user.roles=ADMIN
You can also add multiple users via custom configuration (explained below).

3️⃣ Secure All Endpoints by Default
Spring Security automatically secures all endpoints unless configured otherwise.

4️⃣ Create a Simple Controller
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class DemoController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, authenticated user!";
    }
}
If you now call /api/hello, it will prompt for Basic Auth credentials.

5️⃣ Customize Security (Optional – if you want multiple users or roles)
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .httpBasic() // enables Basic Auth
            .and()
            .csrf().disable(); // disable for testing purposes

        return http.build();
    }

    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        var user1 = User.withUsername("admin")
                .password("{noop}admin123") // {noop} = no password encoder
                .roles("ADMIN")
                .build();

        var user2 = User.withUsername("user")
                .password("{noop}user123")
                .roles("USER")
                .build();

        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user1, user2);
    }
}
☝️ Here we define multiple users programmatically, not via application.properties.

🧪 Testing
Call your endpoint:
GET http://localhost:8080/api/hello
Use basic auth with:
Username: admin
Password: admin123

✅ If credentials are correct, controller executes.
❌ If wrong, Spring returns 401 Unauthorized before reaching the controller.

🔐 Optional: Custom Auth Message (Before Controller)
If you want to add custom auth logic, you can write a filter or authentication provider, but for most apps, the above setup 
	is clean and secure.

✅ Summary
Goal								Achieved?
Auth before controller				- ✅ Yes
Config via application.properties	- ✅ Yes (simple user)
Easily extendable					- ✅ Use custom beans
Uses Spring Security filter chain	- ✅ Yes

🔐 1. CSRF – Cross-Site Request Forgery
✅ What is it?
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack where a malicious website causes a user’s browser to perform unintended actions
 on another website where the user is authenticated.

🔁 Real-world example:
Imagine you are logged into your banking site. Then, you visit a malicious site that silently sends a request to:
POST https://mybank.com/transfer-money
Body: amount=5000&toAccount=attacker123
Since you're already logged in, your session cookies are sent automatically, and the bank processes the request, thinking it's 
	from you!

🛡️ How to Prevent CSRF?
CSRF Tokens: The server sends a unique token with every form. When the client submits the form, it must include this token.
Spring Security automatically adds and validates CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (POST, PUT, DELETE).
📌 CSRF is a concern mainly for stateful apps using cookies for auth.

🔐 2. JWT – JSON Web Token
✅ What is it?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, self-contained token used to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.

JWT is commonly used for:
Authentication (stateless login)
Authorization (roles/permissions)
Secure API communication

🧱 JWT Structure:
A JWT has three parts:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.         // Header
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxN... // Payload
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c   // Signature
Header – Type & signing algorithm
Payload – Data like user ID, roles, issued-at time
Signature – To verify the token’s integrity

🔐 JWT Authentication Flow:
User logs in with username/password.
Server validates and returns a JWT token.
Client sends this token in Authorization header for each API call:
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Server validates token and grants access — no session needed!

🧾 Key Differences Between CSRF and JWT
Feature				CSRF							JWT
Type				Security vulnerability			Authentication/Authorization method
Affects				Cookie-based sessions			Not applicable
Prevented By		CSRF tokens						N/A
Requires State?		Yes (session state)				No (stateless)
Use Case			Prevents cross-site attacks		Secure token-based auth

✅ Summary
Term	Full Form						Role
CSRF	Cross-Site Request Forgery		Security threat to defend against
JWT		JSON Web Token					Mechanism for stateless auth

🌱 What is Scope in Spring Boot?
Scope defines the lifecycle and visibility of a Spring bean — i.e., how long the bean instance lives and when a new instance
 is created.

✅ Default Scope: singleton
One instance per Spring IoC container
Shared across the entire application context
Default for all Spring beans

🧾 Common Spring Scopes
Scope				Description												Typical Use Case
singleton (default)	Single shared instance per Spring container				Stateless service beans
prototype			New instance every time the bean is requested			Stateful or short-lived objects
request				One bean instance per HTTP request						Web applications, per HTTP request data
session				One bean instance per HTTP session						User session data in web apps
application			One instance per ServletContext (application-wide)		Shared resources in a web app
websocket			One instance per WebSocket session						WebSocket-based communication

🔧 How to Set Scope in Spring Boot
You use the @Scope annotation on your bean or component class.
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyPrototypeBean {
    // ...
}
🧠 Example: Common Scopes Usage
@Service
@Scope("singleton") // optional, singleton is default
public class MySingletonService {
    // One instance for entire app
}

@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class MyPrototypeComponent {
    // New instance every injection/request
}

@Component
@Scope(value = "request", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
public class MyRequestScopedBean {
    // One per HTTP request
}
Note: For scopes like request and session, Spring needs proxying to inject beans correctly into singleton beans.

📝 Summary Table
Scope		Description							Lifecycle
singleton	One shared instance					Application lifetime
prototype	New instance per request			When requested
request		One per HTTP request				Life of HTTP request
session		One per HTTP session				Life of HTTP session
application	One per ServletContext (web app)	Life of ServletContext

🧩 When to use?
Singleton: Default, for stateless services
Prototype: For stateful or frequently changing beans
Request/Session: When building web apps that require per-request or per-user data storage

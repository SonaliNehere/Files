## **üîπ Updated Profile Summary**

### **Q0: What is your expertise as a Software Developer?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** I have **2.7 years of experience** in **backend development using Java and Spring Boot**, with hands-on experience in **RESTful API development, microservices, database optimization, caching (Redis), and frontend integration using Angular**. Additionally, I have **experience with Docker for containerization and AWS (EC2, S3) for cloud deployments.**  

### **Q1: What is a RESTful API?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** A RESTful API follows the **REST (Representational State Transfer)** architectural style, allowing communication between clients and servers. Key principles include:
- **Statelessness** ‚Äì Each request is independent and contains all necessary information.
- **Resource-Based URLs** ‚Äì API endpoints represent resources (e.g., `/products/{id}`).
- **HTTP Methods** ‚Äì Uses GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for operations.
- **JSON or XML Data Format** ‚Äì Typically, APIs exchange data in JSON.

### **Q2: How did you implement RESTful APIs in your project?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**
- Developed **Spring Boot-based REST APIs** to handle CRUD operations.
- Used **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions.
- Implemented **JWT authentication** to secure API endpoints.
- Optimized performance using **caching (Redis) and pagination.**

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Java**

### **Q3: What are Java Streams, and how do they work?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java Streams API allows functional-style processing of data collections. Common methods include:
- **map()** ‚Äì Transforms elements.
- **filter()** ‚Äì Selects elements based on conditions.
- **collect()** ‚Äì Aggregates results (e.g., converting to a List).

### **Q4: How does Garbage Collection work in Java?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java's Garbage Collector (GC) automatically removes unused objects. GC algorithms include:
- **Young Generation (Eden, Survivor spaces)** ‚Äì Frequent short-lived objects.
- **Old Generation (Tenured space)** ‚Äì Long-lived objects.
- **G1 GC, CMS GC** ‚Äì Advanced collectors for optimizing performance.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced System Design**

### **Q5: How do you design a scalable e-commerce system?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**
- **Load Balancers** ‚Äì Distribute requests across multiple servers.
- **Microservices Architecture** ‚Äì Separate services for products, orders, payments.
- **Database Optimization** ‚Äì Indexing, sharding, caching (Redis, Elasticsearch).
- **Asynchronous Processing** ‚Äì Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven workflows.

### **Q6: What is Event-Driven Architecture?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) enables services to communicate asynchronously through events.
- **Producers generate events** (e.g., order placed).
- **Consumers process events** (e.g., send confirmation email).
- **Kafka, RabbitMQ** are commonly used for event-driven systems.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Microservices**

### **Q7: How does OAuth2 work for securing microservices?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** OAuth2 is an authentication framework that issues **access tokens** for secure API interactions.
- **Client Credentials Flow** ‚Äì For machine-to-machine communication.
- **Authorization Code Flow** ‚Äì For user authentication with redirects.
- **Refresh Tokens** ‚Äì Extend session lifespan without re-authentication.

### **Q8: How did you implement JWT authentication in Spring Boot?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**
- Generated JWT token using **Spring Security & Java JWT library**.
- Secured API endpoints with a **JWT filter**.
- Stored user roles in the token for **role-based authorization**.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Databases & Caching**

### **Q9: What is Redis, and how did you use it?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Redis is an in-memory key-value store used for caching and real-time applications.
- **Session Management** ‚Äì Stored user sessions in Redis.
- **Caching API Responses** ‚Äì Reduced database load by storing frequently accessed queries.
- **Message Broker** ‚Äì Used Redis Pub/Sub for event-driven notifications.

### **Q10: How does Elasticsearch work for full-text search?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Elasticsearch uses **inverted indexing** for fast text searches.
- **Tokenizer & Analyzer** ‚Äì Breaks text into searchable tokens.
- **Search Queries** ‚Äì Supports fuzzy search, autocomplete, and ranking.
- **Used in e-commerce** to enable fast product searches.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ DevOps & Cloud**

### **Q11: How does Docker improve software deployment?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Docker **containerizes applications**, ensuring:
- **Portability** ‚Äì Works the same across dev, test, and production.
- **Isolation** ‚Äì Dependencies bundled in containers.
- **Scaling** ‚Äì Easily replicate containers for load balancing.

### **Q12: What is Kubernetes, and why use it?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Kubernetes automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Self-Healing** ‚Äì Restarts failed containers.
- **Auto-Scaling** ‚Äì Adjusts resources based on demand.
- **Service Discovery** ‚Äì Manages internal communication between services.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Tools & Platforms (Postman, Kibana, Git)**

### **Q13: How do you test APIs using Postman?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**
- **Sent GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests** to test APIs.
- **Added authentication headers** (JWT, OAuth2).
- **Wrote automated test scripts** using Postman‚Äôs test framework.

### **Q14: What is Kibana, and how does it help with logs?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Kibana is a visualization tool for **Elasticsearch logs and metrics**.
- **Used for debugging API errors.**
- **Created real-time dashboards** for API response times.
- **Analyzed trends** in system performance.

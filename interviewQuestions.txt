## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Java**

### **Q1: What are the key features of Java?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for:  
- **Platform Independence** (Write Once, Run Anywhere using JVM)  
- **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**  
- **Multithreading & Concurrency**  
- **Robust Exception Handling**  
- **Strong Security Features**  

### **Q2: Explain OOPs concepts in Java.**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Java follows four main OOP principles:  
- **Encapsulation:** Hiding implementation details using private variables and public methods.  
- **Inheritance:** Reusing code by extending a class.  
- **Polymorphism:** Multiple forms of a method (Overloading & Overriding).  
- **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation using abstract classes and interfaces.  

### **Q3: How do you handle multithreading in Java?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Multithreading in Java is managed using:  
- **Thread class:** Extend `Thread` class and override `run()` method.  
- **Runnable interface:** Implement `Runnable` and pass it to `Thread` constructor.  
- **Executors framework:** Manage thread pools efficiently for better performance.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Spring Boot & Microservices**

### **Q4: What is Spring Boot and how does it simplify backend development?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Spring Boot is a framework that simplifies **Spring application development** by providing:  
- **Auto-configuration** (No manual XML configuration needed)  
- **Embedded Servers** (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.)  
- **Starter Dependencies** (spring-boot-starter-web, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa)  

### **Q5: How did you implement microservices in your projects?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** I implemented **Spring Boot microservices** with:  
- **RESTful APIs for service communication.**  
- **Database per service approach (MySQL, Redis for caching).**  
- **JWT authentication and OAuth2 for secure API access.**  
- **API Gateway for centralized routing and authentication.**  

### **Q6: What is JWT authentication, and how did you implement it?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for secure authentication in APIs. I implemented it in my **Backend API project** by:  
- Generating **JWT tokens** after user login.  
- Validating the **token in each API request** using a filter.  
- Using **Spring Security** for role-based access control.  

### **Q7: How did you optimize Spring Boot performance?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Optimized API performance using:  
- **Caching (Redis, KeyDB) to store frequently accessed data.**  
- **Indexing in MySQL & Elasticsearch** for faster query execution.  
- **Asynchronous processing** for background tasks.  
- **Connection pooling** to optimize database interactions.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Databases & Caching**

### **Q8: How does Elasticsearch improve search performance?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Elasticsearch uses **inverted indexing** for full-text search, making it much faster than SQL databases for **search queries**. In my projects, I used it for:  
- **Efficient product searches in the e-commerce platform.**  
- **Reducing database load by indexing frequently searched data.**  

### **Q9: How did you use Redis in your projects?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Redis was used for:  
- **Caching frequently accessed database queries** to improve API response times.  
- **Session management** for user authentication.  
- **Storing real-time data updates in microservices.**

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend (Angular, TypeScript, UI Integration)**

### **Q10: What experience do you have with Angular?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** In my **E-commerce project**, I used Angular for:  
- **Building dynamic product search and filtering components.**  
- **Integrating APIs with real-time Firebase updates.**  
- **Improving UI responsiveness using lazy loading & optimized API calls.**  

### **Q11: How did you integrate frontend with backend APIs?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**  
- Used **Angular HttpClient** to make API calls to backend services.  
- Implemented **Interceptors** for adding authentication tokens.  
- Handled **error responses** gracefully with Angular services.

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Tools & Platforms (Docker, AWS, Postman, Kibana, Git)**

### **Q12: How did you use Docker in your projects?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** Docker was used for:  
- **Containerizing Spring Boot microservices** for portability.  
- **Running MySQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch containers** locally for development/testing.  
- **Ensuring consistent environments across development and production.**  

### **Q13: What AWS services have you worked with?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:** I have **basic experience with AWS (EC2, S3)**:  
- **EC2** for hosting backend services.  
- **S3** for storing static assets.  

### **Q14: How do you test REST APIs in Postman?**  
‚úÖ **Answer:**  
- Used **Postman** for API testing and debugging.  
- Created **automated test collections** for regression testing.  
- Verified **JWT authentication** and role-based API access.

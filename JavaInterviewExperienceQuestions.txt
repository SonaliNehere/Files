In Java, especially in the context of Streams and functional programming (Java 8+), stateless and stateful operators refer to
	how intermediate stream operations process data.

✅ 1. Stateless Operators
Stateless operators process each element independently, without remembering previous elements.
📌 They don’t need to see the whole stream to work.

🧪 Examples:
map()
filter()
flatMap()
peek()

🧠 Example:
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))  // doesn't depend on previous elements
     .map(String::toUpperCase)
     .forEach(System.out::println);
🔁 Each element is processed individually, and results don’t depend on other elements.

✅ 2. Stateful Operators
💡 Definition:
Stateful operators maintain state or context across multiple elements in the stream. They may need to see all elements before
 processing.
📌 They can’t produce output until some or all data is seen.

🧪 Examples:
sorted()
distinct()
limit()
skip()

🧠 Example:
List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Alice");
names.stream()
     .distinct()  // stateful: must track seen elements
     .forEach(System.out::println);
🔁 distinct() keeps track of previously seen elements — that's internal state.

Term		Meaning in Java Streams
Stateless	- Processes elements independently (e.g., map)
Stateful	- Needs memory or full view of stream (e.g., sorted)

🔍 Reflection in Java — Complete Guide
Reflection is a powerful feature in Java that allows your program to inspect and manipulate classes, methods, fields, and 
constructors at runtime, even if you don't know them at compile time.

🔹 When to Use Reflection
Frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate)
Libraries (e.g., Jackson, Gson)
Debugging tools
Unit testing (e.g., JUnit)
Serialization/deserialization

🔧 How to Use Reflection in Java
✅ 1. Accessing Class Metadata
Class<?> clazz = Class.forName("java.util.ArrayList");
System.out.println("Class Name: " + clazz.getName());

OR for known class:
Class<?> clazz = ArrayList.class;

✅ 2. Accessing Fields
import java.lang.reflect.Field;

class Person {
    private String name = "Sonali";
}

Person p = new Person();
Field field = p.getClass().getDeclaredField("name");
field.setAccessible(true); // to access private fields
System.out.println("Name: " + field.get(p)); // prints "Sonali"

✅ 3. Accessing Methods
import java.lang.reflect.Method;

class Greeting {
    public void sayHello(String name) {
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}

Greeting g = new Greeting();
Method method = g.getClass().getMethod("sayHello", String.class);
method.invoke(g, "Sonali"); // prints "Hello, Sonali"

✅ 4. Creating Objects via Constructor
import java.lang.reflect.Constructor;

Constructor<String> constructor = String.class.getConstructor(String.class);
String str = constructor.newInstance("Reflection");
System.out.println(str); // Reflection

⚠️ Limitations & Risks
Issue						Description
Performance					Slower than direct access
Security					Can break encapsulation, access private fields
Compile-time Safety Lost	No type checking at compile time

💡 Real-World Use Case
Frameworks like Spring use reflection to:
Autowire beans
Handle annotations
Dynamically create proxies

Example:
@Autowired
private SomeService service;
Spring uses reflection to set service at runtime.

🧠 Interview Q&A
🔸 Q: What is Java Reflection API?
A: A feature that allows inspection and manipulation of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime.

🔸 Q: Can reflection access private members?
A: Yes, using setAccessible(true), but it breaks encapsulation and should be avoided unless necessary.

🔸 Q: What are alternatives to reflection?
A: Design patterns like strategy or factory, annotation processors, or code generation tools like Lombok or MapStruct.


if this are drwabacks of reflection then why to use it


Drawback			Concern
🐢 Performance		Slower than direct access due to runtime resolution
🔓 Security Risk	Can bypass private, protected, final constraints
❌ Type Safety		Errors can only occur at runtime, not compile time
👩‍🔬 Maintainability	Harder to read, debug, and refactor

✅ But Still, Reflection Is Used Widely Because It Enables POWERFUL Features
Reflection unlocks capabilities that are otherwise impossible or too rigid to implement.

🔸 1. Frameworks Need It to Be Generic and Flexible
Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, JUnit, Jackson, etc., use reflection to handle unknown classes and fields at runtime.

✅ Examples:
@Autowired, @Entity, @RequestMapping — handled using reflection.
JUnit scans for methods with @Test and runs them via reflection.
You can’t hardcode this — it must work with any user class dynamically.

🔸 2. Dynamic Behavior
Reflection enables dynamic object creation and method execution, which is essential for:
Plugins
Serialization
Dependency Injection
ORM (like Hibernate)

✅ Example:
Object obj = Class.forName("com.jio.MyService").getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
You don’t know the class at compile time, but it still works.

🔸 3. Testing and Tooling
Reflection is crucial for:
Writing unit testing frameworks (like JUnit)
Code analyzers (e.g., FindBugs)
Logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j)
They scan and work with your code dynamically.

🧠 Interview-Friendly Analogy
Reflection is like a Swiss Army Knife — not the best tool for everyday tasks, but invaluable when you need flexibility, plugin
 architecture, or runtime scanning.

📌 When to Use Reflection
Use It If...							Avoid It If...
Building a framework					Writing performance-critical code
Need to work with unknown classes		You can use interfaces/abstractions
Doing testing or dynamic injection		Compile-time safety is essential

✅ Conclusion
Reflection is not for everyday use, but it's essential in situations where flexibility, extensibility, and runtime dynamics
 are needed — especially in frameworks, libraries, and tools.

💎 Diamond Problem with Default Methods in Java Interfaces – Solved Clearly
🧠 What is the Diamond Problem?
It arises when a class inherits multiple default methods from interfaces that have the same method signature.

Java interfaces can have default methods (from Java 8+), but Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance of classes, only 
	interfaces.

🧨 Problem Example:
interface A {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("A's show");
    }
}

interface B {
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("B's show");
    }
}

// Class C implements both A and B
class C implements A, B {
    // Compilation error: Duplicate default methods
}
❌ Error:
class C inherits unrelated defaults for show() from types A and B

✅ How to Solve It?
You must override the method in your class and decide which interface’s method to call, or write your own.

✅ Solution: Override and Resolve
class C implements A, B {
    @Override
    public void show() {
        // Choose one or combine logic
        A.super.show();  // or B.super.show();
        // or custom logic
    }
}
💡 Output:
A's show

✅ You Can Also Combine Both:
@Override
public void show() {
    A.super.show();
    B.super.show();
}
💡 Output:

A's show  
B's show

🔁 Real-World Analogy
It's like two managers giving you the same instruction with slight differences — you, the employee (class), must choose which one to follow or combine both instructions.

📌 Summary
Case											What You Should Do
Two interfaces have the same default method		You must override it in your class
Want logic from one								Use InterfaceName.super.method()
Want to combine both							Call both methods inside your override

==============================================================

string isBlank vs isEmpty - 
✅ isEmpty() – Checks if the string has no characters
Returns true only if the string length is 0.
Does not ignore whitespace.

Input	isEmpty()
""		true
" " 	(space)	false
"abc"	false
null	❌ Throws NullPointerException if you call it on a null reference

✅ isBlank() – Checks if the string is empty or only contains whitespace
Returns true if the string is empty or only contains whitespace characters (' ', '\t', '\n', etc).

Input	isBlank()
""		true
" "		true
" \n\t"	true
"abc"	false
null	❌ Throws NullPointerException if you call it on a null reference

==============================================================

🔚 finalize() in Java – 
finalize() is a method in Java that belongs to the Object class and was historically used to perform cleanup operations before
 an object is garbage collected.

🧠 Syntax:
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    // cleanup code
}
You can override this method in your class.

🧹 Purpose:
Originally, finalize() was used to:
Close files
Release resources (e.g., DB connections, sockets)
Do cleanup work before the object is destroyed

🔁 Example:
public class MyClass {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("Finalize called for MyClass object");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass();
        obj = null;

        // Suggest garbage collection
        System.gc();
        System.out.println("End of main");
    }
}
Output:
End of main
Finalize called for MyClass object
(Note: The finalize message may not always appear immediately or at all, as GC is not guaranteed to run.)

⚠️ Problems with finalize():
Unpredictable timing – No guarantee when or even if it will be called.
Performance overhead – Objects with finalize() may take longer to be garbage collected.
Dangerous – Can lead to subtle bugs if resources aren’t released properly.
Can resurrect objects – Object can become reachable again in finalize() (bad practice).

🚫 Deprecated (Java 9+)
Java 9: finalize() marked as deprecated.
Java 18+: Strongly discouraged; likely to be removed in future.

💡 Alternative: Use try-with-resources and implement AutoCloseable for resource management.

✅ Modern Alternative: AutoCloseable
public class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
    @Override
    public void close() {
        System.out.println("Resource closed");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (MyResource r = new MyResource()) {
            System.out.println("Using resource");
        }
    }
}
Output:
Using resource
Resource closed

✅ Summary
Feature			finalize()
Defined in		java.lang.Object
Used for		Cleanup before GC
Call timing		Unpredictable
Deprecated		Since Java 9
Replacement		AutoCloseable + try-with-resources
Recommended?	❌ No

🧮 1. What is a Shallow Copy?
A shallow copy creates a new object, but does not copy nested objects (references). Instead, it copies the references, meaning 
	both objects share the same inner objects.
	
🔁 2. What is a Deep Copy?
A deep copy duplicates the object and everything it references recursively. So inner objects are also cloned independently.

==============================================================

✅ Q: What is the difference between volatile and Atomic in Java?
🔹 volatile:
The volatile keyword is used with variables to ensure visibility of changes across threads.
When a variable is declared volatile, every read/write goes directly to the main memory, not the CPU cache.
It does not guarantee atomicity (i.e., compound actions like count++ are still not thread-safe).
Suitable for simple flags or state variables.

Example:
private volatile boolean flag = false;

🔹 Atomic (e.g., AtomicInteger):
Part of java.util.concurrent.atomic package.
Provides atomic operations on variables (like get(), set(), incrementAndGet()) using low-level CPU instructions (CAS - Compare
 And Swap).
Ensures both visibility and atomicity.
Suitable for counters, accumulators, or any variable updated concurrently.

Example:
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
counter.incrementAndGet(); // thread-safe increment

🔄 Key Differences:
Feature		volatile				Atomic
Visibility	✅ Yes					✅ Yes
Atomicity	❌ No					✅ Yes
Use-case	Flags, state			Counters, accumulators
Package		Built-in Java keyword	java.util.concurrent.atomic

👨‍💼 In an Interview, You Can Conclude:
"volatile is used when I only need to ensure visibility between threads, while Atomic classes are used when I need atomic 
operations with thread safety — especially for shared counters or accumulators."
==============================================================

✅ Q: What is the Double-Checked Locking Singleton Pattern in Java?
🔹 Purpose:
Double-Checked Locking (DCL) is used to create a thread-safe Singleton instance with lazy initialization and high performance.

🔧 Why Double-Checked?
First check: Avoids locking once the instance is initialized (for performance).
Second check (inside synchronized block): Ensures only one instance is created even if multiple threads try to initialize 
	simultaneously.

💡 Code Example:
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) { // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) { // Second check (with locking)
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
🔐 Why volatile is important?
Without volatile, instruction reordering can occur:
A reference to the instance could be returned before the constructor finishes execution.

volatile ensures:
Visibility (other threads see the latest value),
No reordering.

🔄 Flow Summary:
First thread enters getInstance(), sees null, enters synchronized, creates instance.
Second thread enters getInstance(), sees non-null and skips synchronization — improving performance.

Ensures thread safety + lazy loading + good performance.

🧠 Interview Tip:
"Double-checked locking solves the problem of creating a thread-safe Singleton with better performance than synchronizing 
	the entire method. The key is using the volatile keyword to prevent instruction reordering."
==============================================================

✅ Q: What is ExecutorService in Java? Why is it used?
🔹 Definition:
ExecutorService is part of the java.util.concurrent package.
It provides a higher-level API for managing threads compared to manually creating Thread objects.

Instead of doing:
new Thread(() -> doSomething()).start();

You use:
executorService.submit(() -> doSomething());

🔹 Why Use ExecutorService?
Manages a pool of threads.
Reuses threads — better performance than creating new ones every time.
Allows task submission, scheduling, and shutdown.
Supports Callable (returns result) and Runnable (no result).

💡 Common Methods:
Method						Description
submit(Runnable/Callable)	Submits a task for execution
shutdown()					Gracefully shuts down the executor
shutdownNow()				Immediately stops all running tasks
invokeAll()					Submits a collection of tasks and waits
invokeAny()					Executes multiple tasks, returns first result

🔧 Code Example:
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> System.out.println("Task 1 running");
        Callable<String> task2 = () -> {
            return "Result from Task 2";
        };

        executor.submit(task1);

        Future<String> result = executor.submit(task2);
        try {
            System.out.println(result.get()); // blocking call
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}

🔄 Types of Executors:
Use factory methods from Executors class:

Executor Type	Description
newFixedThreadPool(n)	Fixed number of threads
newSingleThreadExecutor()	Single worker thread
newCachedThreadPool()	Creates new threads as needed, reuses idle ones
newScheduledThreadPool()	Executes tasks after delay or periodically

🧠 Interview Tip:
"ExecutorService abstracts away thread management and makes concurrent programming cleaner, scalable, and more efficient. 
	It's especially useful for server-side applications that handle multiple tasks or requests."
==============================================================

✅ Q: What is the difference between Callable and Runnable in Java?
Both Callable and Runnable are used to represent tasks for concurrent execution, but they have some key differences:

🔹 1. Return Type
Feature				Runnable							Callable
Returns value		❌ No return						✅ Returns a value (via Future)
Throws exception	❌ Cannot throw checked exceptions	✅ Can throw checked exceptions

🔹 2. Method Signature
Runnable:
public void run();

Callable<V>:
public V call() throws Exception;

🔹 3. Use with ExecutorService
Runnable is submitted using:
executor.submit(Runnable);

Callable is submitted using:
Future<V> future = executor.submit(Callable);

🔧 Example:
✅ Using Runnable
Runnable task = () -> {
    System.out.println("Running task");
};
executorService.submit(task); // No result returned

✅ Using Callable
Callable<String> task = () -> {
    return "Result from Callable";
};
Future<String> future = executorService.submit(task);
System.out.println(future.get()); // "Result from Callable"

🧠 Interview Tip:
"Runnable is good for tasks that don't return a result, while Callable is better when you need to get a result or handle 
	exceptions. Callable works well with Future for asynchronous processing."
==============================================================

✅ Q: What is ThreadLocal in Java and when would you use it?
🔹 Definition:
ThreadLocal provides thread-local variables, meaning each thread accessing the variable has its own isolated copy.

It’s useful when:
You want to avoid shared mutable state between threads.
You need per-thread storage (like user sessions, DB connections, date formats, etc.).

🔧 How it works:
Each thread holds an independent value in a ThreadLocal variable.
No thread can see or modify another thread’s value.

💡 Example:
public class ThreadLocalExample {
    private static ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalValue = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            threadLocalValue.set(threadLocalValue.get() + 1);
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " = " + threadLocalValue.get());
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-A");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-B");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
Output (sample):
Thread-A = 2
Thread-B = 2
Each thread gets its own ThreadLocal copy.

🔄 Common Methods:
Method					Description
get()					Returns current thread’s value
set(value)				Sets value for current thread
remove()				Removes value for current thread
withInitial(Supplier)	Creates with default value

🧠 When to Use ThreadLocal:
User session data in multi-threaded web apps
Simple caching in threads
Avoiding synchronization on shared resources
DateFormat (non-thread-safe class)

⚠️ Important:
Always call remove() after use to avoid memory leaks, especially in thread pools (like in web servers).

👨‍💼 Interview Tip:
"ThreadLocal gives each thread its own copy of a variable, which helps eliminate race conditions without synchronization. 
	It’s ideal when threads need isolated, reusable data like database connections or formatters."
